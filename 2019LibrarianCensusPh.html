<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Librarianship in the Philippines is a dynamic and evolving field, adapting to the rapid technological advancements and changes in information consumption. This profession has expanded its horizons to include the traditional roles of book management and lending and information literacy, digital resources, community engagement, research support, and more. This study, conceived against this vibrant backdrop, aims to offer a granular understanding of the current state, challenges, opportunities, and prospects of librarianship in the country by developing a national population estimate for librarians. This data about librarians is vital for effective decision-making, resource allocation, and professional advocacy in the library profession. Population statistics play a fundamental role in shaping various aspects of society, including educational planning, labor market analysis, and policy formulation <span class="citation" data-cites="Thygesen2010">(<a href="#ref-Thygesen2010" role="doc-biblioref">Thygesen, 2010</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The Philippines, with its diverse and rapidly evolving library landscape, requires comprehensive population statistics to support evidence-based strategies that foster the growth and development of the library workforce. This report examines the significance of population statistics on librarians in the Philippines, highlighting their contribution to informed decision-making, resource optimization, and enhanced library services.</p>
<p>A perfect example of where this type of information could have been most helpful is when a lawmaker and the head of The National Library were misinformed about the true nature of librarianship in the Philippines, as published in <em>Philippine Star</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="Adel2020">(<a href="#ref-Adel2020" role="doc-biblioref">Adel, 2020</a>)</span>. This incident was immediately rectified by a Board for Librarians member and a library school dean. Without immediate intervention, this could have resulted in the misappropriation of resources and poor legislation that could significantly impact the library profession. Having published population statistics about the work will aid systematic data collection and analysis to support evidence-based planning and decision-making for the sustainable growth of the librarian workforce in the country.</p>
<section id="purpose-and-scope" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="purpose-and-scope">Purpose and Scope</h2>
<p>This study aims to comprehensively understand the librarian profession in the Philippines by establishing population parameters. By doing so, it seeks to offer insights into librarians’ demographics, professional landscapes, educational attainments, affiliations, roles, challenges, and aspirations. These population parameters are crucial for data-driven decision-making, enabling researchers to make informed choices when formulating hypotheses, designing studies, or identifying gaps in the literature. Policymakers can also benefit from these parameters as they can tailor policies to address specific needs, challenges, and opportunities within the profession, creating an environment conducive to the growth and sustainability of librarianship. Additionally, professional organizations can use the insights from this study to better serve their members and the broader librarian community by tailoring their programs, initiatives, and strategies. The implications of this study include advancing research in librarianship, implementing strategic policies that have a tangible impact, empowering professional organizations to make informed decisions, and elevating the profession by addressing challenges and harnessing opportunities. Overall, this study is a foundational pillar for understanding, advancing, and promoting the librarianship profession in the Philippines, ensuring a promising future for all involved.</p>

<section id="review-of-literature" class="level1">
<h1>Review of Literature</h1>
<p>Research regarding demographic studies of librarians is scarce. Compared to certain professions or industries, librarianship receives less attention in research due to its significance, impact, or relevance in a particular context. For example, professions such as healthcare, education, business, and technology are often the focus of extensive research, given their wide-ranging implications and societal importance <span class="citation" data-cites="Brock2016">(<a href="#ref-Brock2016" role="doc-biblioref">Brock, 2016</a>)</span>. Other fields like psychology, sociology, and economics often explore various professions and occupations to investigate job satisfaction, work-life balance, career development, and organizational behavior<span class="citation" data-cites="Judge2001">(<a href="#ref-Judge2001" role="doc-biblioref">Judge et al., 2001</a>)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Setiawan2019">(<a href="#ref-Setiawan2019" role="doc-biblioref">Setiawan et al., 2019</a>)</span>. Furthermore, research subjects can also vary based on temporal and contextual factors. For instance, certain professions or industries may gain prominence as research subjects in response to emerging challenges or societal trends <span class="citation" data-cites="Rahmani2022">(<a href="#ref-Rahmani2022" role="doc-biblioref">Rahmani et al., 2022</a>)</span>. Examples include studies on the impact of automation on jobs, the gig economy, or the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on specific professions. Therefore, research such as this is crucial to gain more exposure and insight into the library profession.</p>
<p>Filipino librarians are recognized as professionals in their field, as they must pass a licensure examination provided by the state <span class="citation" data-cites="Yap2023">(<a href="#ref-Yap2023" role="doc-biblioref">J. Yap et al., 2023</a>)</span>. This examination ensures librarians possess the necessary knowledge and skills to perform their duties effectively. This has led to a growing emphasis on the competencies of modern Filipino librarians. A study conducted in 2017 examined the perceived competencies of Filipino librarians and highlighted the importance of keeping up with advancements in library science and computer science <span class="citation" data-cites="Santos2017">(<a href="#ref-Santos2017" role="doc-biblioref">Santos, 2017</a>)</span>. This suggests that Filipino librarians need to continuously update their skills and knowledge to meet the evolving needs of their profession <span class="citation" data-cites="Floro Fernandez2015 Yap2016 Austria2020 Frias2020">(<a href="#ref-Austria2020" role="doc-biblioref">Austria and Cabonero, 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-Fernandez2015" role="doc-biblioref">Fernandez and Buenrostro Jr, 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-Floro" role="doc-biblioref">Floro and Masalinto, n.d.</a>; <a href="#ref-Frias2020" role="doc-biblioref">Frias and Daria, 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-Yap2016" role="doc-biblioref">J. M. Yap, 2016</a>)</span>.</p>
<section id="demographic-data-gap" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="demographic-data-gap">Demographic Data Gap</h2>
<p>Demographic data collection of librarians is a critical aspect of research and understanding the experiences and characteristics of librarians in different contexts. However, including demographic information on librarians in research reports is often lacking or incomplete <span class="citation" data-cites="VanScoy2017">(<a href="#ref-VanScoy2017" role="doc-biblioref">VanScoy and Bright, 2017</a>)</span>. This gap in data collection is evident in various areas of librarianship, including recruitment/retention and leadership. For example, research on minority librarians has focused on these areas but often fails to include comprehensive demographic information.</p>
<p>One area of librarianship that has received limited attention regarding demographic data collection is academic/research librarians with subject doctorates. Despite recent efforts to recruit these librarians, there is a lack of literature exploring their demographic profile, educational background, paths into librarianship, and range of positions. Understanding the demographic characteristics of this group is essential for providing information to the academic/research library community and attracting advanced degree holders to consider a career in librarianship <span class="citation" data-cites="Lindquist2008">(<a href="#ref-Lindquist2008" role="doc-biblioref">Lindquist and Gilman, 2008</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In the field of digital librarianship, there is a need to collect demographic data to identify the technical skills required for these positions. As libraries and research institutions continue to work on digital collections, digital librarians must possess specialized skills to keep up with current web technology trends. A study analyzing technical skills sought for digital librarian positions found that current students and practicing librarians need additional non-curricular opportunities to build competency in these specialized areas <span class="citation" data-cites="Tzoc2011">(<a href="#ref-Tzoc2011" role="doc-biblioref">Tzoc and Millard, 2011</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Demographic data collection is also essential in understanding the profile of special librarians in specific regions. A study profiling Caribbean special librarians collected data on demographics, skills, and professional progress <span class="citation" data-cites="Gosine-Boodoo2006">(<a href="#ref-Gosine-Boodoo2006" role="doc-biblioref">Gosine-Boodoo, 2006</a>)</span>. The study highlighted gender, qualifications, length of professional service, job functions, perception of skills, and development opportunities. This demographic data can provide insights into the characteristics and experiences of special librarians in the Caribbean region.</p>
<p>In the context of collaboration between teacher librarians and their colleagues, demographic data can help understand the roles and characteristics of effective partnerships <span class="citation" data-cites="Merga2019">(<a href="#ref-Merga2019" role="doc-biblioref">Merga, 2019</a>)</span>. Strong associations between librarians and teachers can enhance students’ learning experiences and outcomes. Collecting demographic data on teacher librarians’ collaboration ideas can provide valuable insights into improving school literacy and literature learning.</p>

<section id="data-collection-agents" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-collection-agents">Data Collection Agents</h2>
<p>In the U.S., data about a specific profession, like librarians, are collected by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Data collected are then used to create industry profiles. These industry profiles, like librarians and media collections specialists, provide valuable insights into employment trends, job outlook, educational requirements, and median annual wages <span class="citation" data-cites="BLS2023">(<a href="#ref-BLS2023" role="doc-biblioref">Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics, 2023</a>)</span>. These variables are analyzed to generate statistical summaries, reports, and publications on employment and wage trends. These reports provide valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, job seekers, and other stakeholders interested in labor market information. In the case of the Philippines, the closest to this type of data collection is done by the Department of Labor and Employment <span class="citation" data-cites="DOLE2023">(<a href="#ref-DOLE2023" role="doc-biblioref">Department of Labor and Employment, 2023</a>)</span>. They do not have this industry profile, but data about a specific profession is available through the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC).</p>
<p>The American Library Association (ALA) tracks the demographics of its members through several mechanisms and initiatives <span class="citation" data-cites="ALA2017">(<a href="#ref-ALA2017" role="doc-biblioref">ALA Office for Research &amp; Statistics, 2017</a>)</span>. ALA periodically conducts surveys among its members to gather demographic information. These surveys may include questions about age, gender, race/ethnicity, educational background, job title, years of experience, and other relevant demographic factors. The responses obtained from these surveys provide valuable data for understanding the demographics of the membership base. ALA also maintains member profiles and databases that capture information about individual members. These profiles may include demographic data provided during the registration or renewal process. The association can analyze this data to gain insights into the composition of its membership.</p>
<p>Philippine Librarians Association, Inc.&nbsp;(PLAI), the counterpart of the ALA in the Philippines, has tried to collect the same data of its members but has yet to publish any dataset or statistics. Outside of the PRC, the directory developed by Dante <span class="citation" data-cites="Perez2002">Perez (<a href="#ref-Perez2002" role="doc-biblioref">2002</a>)</span> is the only published work that tried to collect data on all Filipino librarians.</p>

<section id="methodology" class="level1">
<h1>Methodology</h1>
<p>This study utilized an exploratory, descriptive quantitative approach to develop an occupational baseline profile of Filipino librarians. The project aimed to summarize and visualize critical patterns in the data.</p>
<section id="instrument" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="instrument">Instrument</h2>
<p>The questionnaire was developed in 2017 by <span class="citation" data-cites="Taban">Taban (<a href="#ref-Taban" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> to identify the minimum questions for a librarian occupational census. It was tested and refined based on feedback. This study represents the first wide-scale implementation of the tool. The online format enabled broad reach but may limit respondents without digital access. Outliers likely reflect unfamiliarity with the tool and data entry errors. The questionnaire also included an informed consent page informing participants that their responses would be reused for further research and published as a separate dataset. This was done to promote transparency and ensure that participants were fully aware of how their data might be used.</p>
</section>
<section id="ethical-considerations" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ethical-considerations">Ethical Considerations</h2>
<p>All participants were informed of their rights, including the right to withdraw from the study at any point without any consequences. We assured all participants that their responses would remain confidential. Identifying information was removed, and pseudonyms were used to ensure anonymity once the dataset was published.</p>
</section>
<section id="data-gathering" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-gathering">Data Gathering</h2>
<p>The researchers used Mentimeter to provide a real-time visualization report of the data gathered. Also, as presented at a conference, it was hoped that a quick view of the data could be delivered after the participants responded. However, due to a lack of time, the questionnaire and the link were only introduced during the 2018 PLAI Congress. The researchers also posted the survey link in the official Facebook group of the different PLAI regional councils to collect responses from librarians who were not present during the PLAI Congress 2018. Six hundred eighty-four responses were recorded that can be used in making statistical inferences with a 4% margin of error.</p>

<p>The raw CSV data exported from the <code>Mentimeter</code> was inspected and cleaned in RStudio<span class="citation" data-cites="RStudio">(<a href="#ref-RStudio" role="doc-biblioref">RStudio Team, 2022</a>)</span> to prepare it for analysis. Rows containing only timestamp information were removed, as these represented incomplete responses. Categorical variables were converted from character to factor types to reflect the nature of the questionnaire items. Frequency distributions for categorical variables were examined using bar charts.</p>
<p>Numerical variables were summarized through histograms, overlapping boxplots, violin plots, and dot plots. Outliers were trimmed in the visualizations to prevent skewing, but statistical measures were calculated using the raw, unfiltered data. An accompanying codebook detailed the exact outlier trimming methods used.</p>
<p>Open-ended responses underwent text mining analysis to determine overall sentiment. Word counts and proximities were used to generate a dendrogram visualizing relationships.</p>
<p>Additional variables were created to facilitate summarization, such as collapsing the age variable into groups:</p>
<p>21 to 30<br>
31 to 40<br>
41 to 50<br>
51 to 60<br>
Greater than 60</p>
<p>This data cleaning and preparation stage formatted the raw data into a tidy form for further exploratory analysis and visualization using tools like those in the <code>tidyverse</code> package.

<p>Data analysis was conducted using RStudio 2022.02.3+492 “Prairie Trillium” Release on a Windows operating system <span class="citation" data-cites="RStudio">(<a href="#ref-RStudio" role="doc-biblioref">RStudio Team, 2022</a>)</span>. The programming language used was R version 4.2.1.<span class="citation" data-cites="R">(<a href="#ref-R" role="doc-biblioref">R Core Team, 2022</a>)</span>. Data manipulation and visualization relied primarily on the tidyverse package (version 1.3.2)<span class="citation" data-cites="tidyverse">(<a href="#ref-tidyverse" role="doc-biblioref">Wickham et al., 2019</a>)</span>, which provides tools like <code>dplyr</code>, <code>tidyr</code>, <code>ggplot2</code>, etc., for data wrangling and plotting. The <code>tm</code> package (version 0.7-8)<span class="citation" data-cites="tm">(<a href="#ref-tm" role="doc-biblioref">Feinerer and Hornik, 2020</a>)</span> was utilized for text mining and natural language processing.</p>
<p>The data set was loaded into RStudio and initially explored using functions like <code>str()</code>, <code>summary()</code>, and <code>glimpse()</code> to understand the structure, variables, data types, and basic summary statistics. Any necessary data cleaning or preprocessing steps, like handling missing values, were performed at this stage.</p>
<p>For analysis, data was manipulated using tidyverse tools like <code>filter()</code>, <code>mutate()</code>, <code>group_by()</code>, and <code>summarize()</code> to filter rows, create new variables, group data, and generate summary statistics. Data visualizations like bar charts, histograms, and box and whisker plots were created using ggplot2 to understand relationships and distributions.</p>
<p>The <code>tm</code> package was used for text data to convert text to a corpus, clean, and transform the text by removing stopwords, stemming, etc. Text mining techniques like topic modeling and creating document-term matrices were applied using <code>tm</code> functions.</p>
<p>All data analysis was reproducible using R Markdown documents. The code was modularized into reusable functions to ensure clarity and reproducibility. All preprocessing steps, analysis code, and results were documented. The final report was compiled from R Markdown to share findings <span class="citation" data-cites="authors">(<a href="#ref-authors" role="doc-biblioref">Obille, 2021</a>)</span>.</p>

<section id="gender-distribution" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="gender-distribution">Gender Distribution</h2>
<p>The gender imbalance in the librarian profession, with a significant proportion of female librarians compared to male librarians, raises concerns about equal opportunities and fair representation. Research has shown that women are often underrepresented in library leadership positions, which can perpetuate gender disparities and limit the diversity of perspectives within the profession <span class="citation" data-cites="Bladek2019">(<a href="#ref-Bladek2019" role="doc-biblioref">Bladek, 2019</a>)</span>. To address this issue, it is essential to implement strategies that promote gender equality and ensure all individuals have equal opportunities for career advancement and leadership roles.</p>
<p>The proportions of librarians with diverse sexual orientations, gender identity, and expression (SOGIE) and those who prefer not to disclose this information highlight the importance of fostering an inclusive and respectful environment within the library profession. Research has shown that individuals from diverse SOGIE backgrounds may face unique challenges and barriers in the workplace, including discrimination and bias <span class="citation" data-cites="Chun2014">(<a href="#ref-Chun2014" role="doc-biblioref">Chun, 2014</a>)</span>. Therefore, it is crucial to continue efforts to create a safe and inclusive space that recognizes and values gender diversity. This can be achieved by implementing diversity and inclusion initiatives, such as training programs, policies, and support networks, that promote understanding, acceptance, and equal treatment for all individuals, regardless of their SOGIE.</p>
<p>Understanding the gender proportions within the librarian workforce can inform the development of library services, programs, and community engagement activities that resonate with the diverse gender composition of the profession. For example, research has shown that women are more likely than men to use library services and participate in library programs <span class="citation" data-cites="King1995">(<a href="#ref-King1995" role="doc-biblioref">King, 1995</a>)</span>. By considering the gender preferences and interests of library users, librarians can tailor their services and programs to meet their diverse clientele’s needs better. This can include offering gender-specific programs, creating inclusive spaces, and providing resources that address the unique interests and concerns of different gender groups.</p>
<p>Institutions and professional bodies should consider implementing gender-specific career development, mentoring, and support initiatives to address the unique needs, challenges, and opportunities faced by different gender groups within the librarian profession. Research has shown that women often face barriers to career advancement, such as gender bias and lack of access to mentorship opportunities <span class="citation" data-cites="Groves2021">(<a href="#ref-Groves2021" role="doc-biblioref">Groves, 2021</a>)</span>. By providing targeted support and resources, such as mentoring programs and professional development opportunities, institutions can help address these barriers and promote gender equality in the profession.</p>
<p>Regularly monitoring gender proportions and trends within the librarian profession is essential for evidence-based decision-making, policy development, and evaluation of gender-related initiatives. By collecting and analyzing data on gender representation, institutions and professional bodies can identify areas of improvement and track progress over time. This can inform the development of targeted interventions and policies that promote gender equality and ensure fair representation within the librarian profession.</p>

<p>The age distribution of librarians is diverse, with librarians falling into different age categories. This diversity brings the potential for fresh perspectives, energy, and adaptability, which can contribute to innovation and the ability to respond to changing trends and technologies in the field. Younger librarians may bring different skills and experiences, such as proficiency in digital technologies and social media, which can enhance the delivery of library services and engage younger library users.</p>
<p>On the other hand, librarians in middle age and older adult categories bring experience, wisdom, and institutional memory to the profession <span class="citation" data-cites="Amoah2019">(<a href="#ref-Amoah2019" role="doc-biblioref">Amoah and Yeboah, 2019</a>)</span>. These librarians have likely accumulated years of experience working in various library settings, which can contribute to mentorship opportunities for younger colleagues and the preservation of institutional knowledge. Additionally, librarians in these age groups may have developed specialized expertise in specific subject areas or library functions, which can be invaluable in providing high-quality services and resources to library users.</p>
<p>Understanding the age distribution of librarians is crucial for planning future staffing needs and ensuring a balanced and sustainable workforce <span class="citation" data-cites="Kung2020">(<a href="#ref-Kung2020" role="doc-biblioref">Kung et al., 2020</a>)</span>. By monitoring the age demographics within the profession, institutions can anticipate retirements and plan for succession, ensuring a smooth transition of knowledge and expertise. Additionally, monitoring age distribution can help identify potential gaps in staffing and inform recruitment strategies to attract individuals from underrepresented age groups. This proactive approach to workforce planning can help libraries adapt to the evolving demands of library services and ensure the continued provision of high-quality resources and support to library users.</p>
<p>To make the most of the age diversity within the librarian community, institutions should consider implementing strategies to retain experienced librarians while attracting younger talent to the profession <span class="citation" data-cites="Couture2020">(<a href="#ref-Couture2020" role="doc-biblioref">Couture et al., 2020</a>)</span>. Flexible working arrangements, such as part-time or remote work options, can appeal to older librarians considering retirement or seeking a better work-life balance. Continued education and professional development opportunities can also help retain librarians of all ages by providing opportunities for growth and skill enhancement. Additionally, leadership development programs can help cultivate the next generation of library leaders and ensure a smooth transition of knowledge and expertise.</p>
<p>By understanding the interests, needs, and preferences of different age groups within the librarian community, librarians can develop targeted programs and resources that resonate with their specific demographics <span class="citation" data-cites="Deeming2001">(<a href="#ref-Deeming2001" role="doc-biblioref">Deeming and Chelin, 2001</a>)</span>. This age diversity can create a more inclusive and responsive library environment that meets the community’s diverse needs. For example, younger librarians may be well-positioned to develop innovative programming for children and teens. In comparison, older librarians may have the expertise to curate collections and services for older adults.</p>
</section>
<section id="location-and-geographic-representation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="location-and-geographic-representation">Location and Geographic Representation</h2>
<p>The higher concentration of librarians in urban areas, such as the National Capital Region, can be attributed to educational institutions, libraries, and information centers. Urban areas often have a higher demand for library services due to the larger population and the presence of universities, colleges, and research institutions that rely on libraries for their academic and research needs. This reflects the need for adequate library resources and services to support these densely populated areas’ educational and information needs.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the differences in the distribution of librarians across regions may indicate disparities in access to library services, resources, and professional development opportunities. Rural and remote areas often face limited funding, infrastructure, and resources, which can impact the availability and quality of library services <span class="citation" data-cites="Real2014">(<a href="#ref-Real2014" role="doc-biblioref">Real et al., 2014</a>)</span>. These disparities can result in unequal access to information and educational opportunities for individuals residing in these regions.</p>
<p>Understanding the geographic distribution of librarians is crucial for informing policies, planning, resource allocation, and collaboration efforts to ensure equitable access and development across regions. By identifying areas with a lower concentration of librarians, policymakers and library administrators can allocate resources and develop strategies to improve library services in these underserved regions <span class="citation" data-cites="DeGuzman2021">(<a href="#ref-DeGuzman2021" role="doc-biblioref">DeGuzman et al., 2021</a>)</span>. This can include initiatives such as mobile libraries, outreach programs, and partnerships with community organizations to extend library services to remote areas. Additionally, collaboration between libraries in different regions can facilitate sharing resources, expertise, and best practices, leading to improved services and outcomes for library users.</p>
<p>Efforts to support librarians in regions with fewer professionals can enhance outreach, inclusion, diversity, and impact. Libraries in underserved areas can promote literacy, lifelong learning, and community development. By providing resources, training, and support to librarians in these areas, libraries can strengthen their capacity to meet the unique needs of their communities. This can include initiatives such as mentorship programs, grants for professional development, and partnerships with local organizations to expand the reach and impact of library services <span class="citation" data-cites="Mohammed2019">(<a href="#ref-Mohammed2019" role="doc-biblioref">Mohammed and Garaba, 2019</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Emphasizing digital access, online resources, and virtual services can bridge geographic gaps and enhance library services across regions. The advancement of technology has provided opportunities for libraries to extend their reach beyond physical locations and offer digital resources and services to users in remote areas. This can include online databases, e-books, virtual reference services, and digital literacy programs. By leveraging digital technologies, libraries can overcome geographical barriers and ensure individuals in all regions can access the information and resources they need <span class="citation" data-cites="Real2014">(<a href="#ref-Real2014" role="doc-biblioref">Real et al., 2014</a>)</span>.</p>

<section id="linguistic-diversity" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="linguistic-diversity">Linguistic Diversity</h2>
<p>The fact that most librarians in the Philippines speak Filipino highlights the linguistic diversity and inclusion within the librarian community. This linguistic diversity reflects the importance of the national language in communication, services, and engagement within the profession. It also signifies the recognition and celebration of the various languages and cultures present in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Speaking Filipino can significantly enhance service delivery, accessibility, and relevance to a broader audience. Communicating in the national language allows librarians to effectively engage with native speakers and individuals with limited proficiency in other languages. This linguistic capability ensures that library services are accessible and inclusive to all community members, regardless of their language background.</p>
<p>Understanding and utilizing the Filipino language and culture can foster cultural sensitivity, relevance, and connections within the librarian profession. Librarians knowledgeable about the Filipino language and culture can better understand the needs and preferences of their community members. This understanding enables librarians to develop culturally relevant programs, services, and resources that resonate with the local community, leading to increased community engagement, collaboration, and impact.</p>
<p>Recognizing librarians’ linguistic preferences and capabilities can guide professional development, training, resources, and collaboration efforts. Institutions and professional bodies can provide opportunities for librarians to enhance their multilingual skills and knowledge through language courses, workshops, and cultural immersion experiences. This professional development can equip librarians with the skills needed to effectively serve diverse linguistic communities and contribute to the overall growth and development of the profession.</p>
<p>Insights into linguistic diversity can support research, innovation, outreach, and the development of inclusive library services. By understanding library users’ linguistic preferences and needs, librarians can tailor their services and resources better to meet the diverse linguistic needs of their communities. This can increase user satisfaction, engagement, and impact within the library profession.</p>

<p>Diverse Sources of CPD: The landscape of professional development opportunities for librarians is mixed, with respondents engaging in CPD from various sources, including private entities, government, and in-house training. This reflects the availability of different avenues for professional education and development.

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="types-of-materials-handled-and-managed">Types of Materials Handled and Managed</h2>
<p>The dominance of electronic materials in Philippine libraries suggests that many patrons still rely on or prefer digital texts. Therefore, librarians should maintain, update, and expand their digital collections. However, they also need to consider digital preservation techniques for these materials.</p>
<p>The significant presence of physical materials in libraries indicates the ongoing importance of hardcopy resources. This aligns with global trends where physical resources are still widely used. To adapt to this diversity, librarians need to invest in physical and digital infrastructure, platforms for resource access, and provide training for staff and patrons on using different types of resources.</p>
<p>The importance of institutional files and records signifies the role of libraries as keepers of institutional memory and history. Particular attention should be given to archiving, cataloging, and digitizing these records to ensure their preservation and accessibility.</p>
<p>While archives have a lower frequency than other materials, they are crucial for research, history, and cultural preservation. Efforts should be made to maintain physical archives and consider possibilities for digitization to make them more accessible to a broader audience.</p>
<p>The wide range of materials mentioned, even outside the top categories, suggests diverse needs among patrons. Therefore, librarians should regularly solicit feedback from patrons to understand and cater to evolving needs.</p>
<p>Considering the rich history and diverse cultures across the islands of the Philippines, libraries should also view local content, languages, and cultural materials in their collections. This is especially important for libraries in different regions or serving specific communities.</p>

<section id="services" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="services">Services</h2>
<p>The significant presence of respondents in administrative roles suggests that administrative tasks, including budgeting, HR, and policy-making, are central to many librarians’ roles in the Philippines <span class="citation" data-cites="Gibbons2021">(<a href="#ref-Gibbons2021" role="doc-biblioref">Gibbons, 2021</a>)</span>. Training and professional development in administrative competencies might be essential to ensure effective library administration.</p>
<p>User services remain a core function in libraries, assisting patrons in finding information and using library resources. To enhance user services, emphasis on up-to-date reference materials and training in digital reference services might be beneficial <span class="citation" data-cites="Foster2004">(<a href="#ref-Foster2004" role="doc-biblioref">Foster, 2004</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Many respondents in managerial roles indicate a possible hierarchical structure in many libraries or a multi-role responsibility for some librarians. Management training, leadership workshops, and courses on team dynamics can be considered to support these professionals.</p>
<p>Although technical services may not be the most common primary job, they remain crucial in libraries to ensure that materials are correctly classified and accessible. Continuous training in modern cataloging practices, mainly digital cataloging, would be beneficial for librarians involved in technical services.</p>

<p>Analyzing the salary groups of librarians can provide insights into various aspects of the profession. One implication is related to equity and fairness. If a significant number of librarians fall into the lower salary groups, it could indicate that many librarians may not be fairly compensated for their skills and contributions. This raises the need for advocacy for improved salaries and benefits, especially if many librarians earn below a living wage <span class="citation" data-cites="Al-Shawabkeh2011">(<a href="#ref-Al-Shawabkeh2011" role="doc-biblioref">Al-Shawabkeh, 2011</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Salary is also a critical component of job satisfaction and retention. If many librarians are in lower salary brackets, it could lead to dissatisfaction and higher turnover rates. Institutions may need to review compensation packages and consider other benefits to improve retention <span class="citation" data-cites="Ikonne2015">(<a href="#ref-Ikonne2015" role="doc-biblioref">Ikonne and Onuoha, 2015</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Another implication is related to professional development. Librarians in higher salary groups might have had more opportunities for professional development or possess specializations that justify higher pay <span class="citation" data-cites="Cooke2012">(<a href="#ref-Cooke2012" role="doc-biblioref">Cooke, 2012</a>)</span>. On the other hand, those in lower brackets might lack resources for further training. To address this, libraries or professional associations might consider offering scholarships, grants, or subsidized training.</p>
<p>The salary groups also have implications for attracting new talent. If starting salaries are not competitive, it could deter potential candidates from considering a career in librarianship. Efforts to highlight other benefits of the profession, such as job satisfaction, growth opportunities, or community impact, might help attract new talent <span class="citation" data-cites="Wilkinson2016">(<a href="#ref-Wilkinson2016" role="doc-biblioref">Wilkinson, 2016</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the overall economic well-being of librarians can influence their ability to engage with and contribute to their communities effectively <span class="citation" data-cites="Vega2007">(<a href="#ref-Vega2007" role="doc-biblioref">Vega and Connell, 2007</a>)</span>. Understanding this can strengthen the case for better compensation in negotiations with policymakers or institutional leaders.</p>
</section>
<section id="benefits" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="benefits">Benefits</h2>
<p>Access to benefits is essential to employee welfare and well-being in the librarian profession. According to a study, approximately 75.76% of librarians have access to some form of benefits. This reflects the organizational commitment to providing support to employees. Most librarians also have access to paid vacation and sick leaves (66.35%) and health insurance (37.88%), contributing to work-life balance and health support. These provisions are crucial for maintaining librarians’ well-being and ensuring they have support.</p>
<p>Monetary support is another crucial aspect of benefits for librarians. Over one-third of librarians receive monetary allowances (35.97%), which offer financial assistance and incentives. This can help alleviate financial burdens and provide additional motivation for librarians in their work.</p>
<p>However, it is worth noting that there are disparities and challenges in access to benefits within the librarian profession. A significant proportion of librarians reported either “NONE / Not Applicable” (16.51%) or “Without Benefits” (16.37%). This highlights the need for further examination of benefit practices and the identification of potential barriers to access.</p>
<p>Fewer librarians receive complimentary shuttle service (5.26%) and night differential pay (4.09%) regarding specific benefits. These numbers reflect the specific employment conditions and practices within the profession.</p>
<p>Understanding benefit distribution is essential for guiding policy formulation, labor standards, and advocacy efforts to ensure equitable access to critical benefits and support mechanisms. Benefits packages can also influence librarians’ recruitment, retention, motivation, and job satisfaction. Therefore, organizations must strategically align benefit packages with industry trends and employee needs.</p>
<p>Further analysis by institution type, tenure, salary level, and other factors may provide nuanced insights into benefit practices and disparities within the librarian profession. This can help identify areas for improvement and inform targeted interventions to address inequities.</p>
